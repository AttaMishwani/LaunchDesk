‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Bookmark Permissions
üîê Firebase Firestore Permission Error

While implementing the bookmarked jobs feature, an issue was encountered related to Firestore security rules. When fetching saved job data for authenticated users, Firebase throws the following error:

makefile
Copy
Edit
FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
This occurs because the current Firestore rules restrict read access to the savedJobs or posts collections. The feature works as expected when permissions are relaxed for development, but stricter production-level rules are currently preventing access for some users.

‚úÖ Bookmarked job data is being correctly stored and retrieved locally via Redux and Firebase.
‚ùå However, Firestore denies read access under current security policies.

This issue will be resolved by updating Firestore rules to securely allow read access for authenticated users to their own saved jobs.

Let me know if you'd like a separate section for a solution or development instructions.
