âœ… Tasks To Do:
Fix Bookmark Save Function

Rename savedJobs.js to bookmarkJob.js (if not already).

Update the function to return docRef.id after saving.

Make sure you're using bookmarkJob() correctly in JobPost.jsx.

Check Firestore Write

Open Firestore console.

Go to savedJobs collection.

Check if a new document with userId and jobId is created when bookmarking.

Ensure Bookmarks Load on Page Refresh

Double-check you're using useSavedJobs(currentUser?.uid) after currentUser is available in Home.jsx.

Verify setSavedJobs(data) is actually updating Redux on load.

Console Debugging

Log savedJobIds from Redux in JobPost.jsx to confirm it's populated.

Add console.log("Fetched bookmarks:", data) in useSavedJobs().

Bonus (Optional)

Add loading state while bookmarks are loading.

Add toast alerts on save/remove for better UX.
