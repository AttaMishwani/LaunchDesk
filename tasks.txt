**4 July 2025 â€“ Progress & Problems**

**What I did:**

* Built Home.jsx with infinite scroll using `useInfiniteQuery` from React Query v5.
* Fetched paginated job posts from Firebase.
* Added search functionality.
* Started building the Delete Account feature.

**Problems faced:**

* Used old React Query syntax (v4), fixed it to v5 format.
* Tried using `firebase-admin` in frontend, got `process is not defined` error (realized it's backend-only).
* Learned how to re-authenticate user before account deletion.

**Next:**

* Complete Delete Account logic with Firebase + Redux cleanup.
