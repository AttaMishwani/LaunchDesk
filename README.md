# Today's Progress

## Tasks Completed:

1. **Implemented Job Post Display**:

   - Created a list of job posts in the `Home` component.
   - Used the `useQuery` hook to fetch data asynchronously with React Query.
   - Displayed job posts with their title, description, and price dynamically.

2. **Added Firebase Integration**:

   - Set up Firebase Firestore to add new posts to the `posts` collection.
   - Created an `addPost` function that adds each post object to the Firestore database.

3. **Post Detail View**:

   - Added functionality to select a post and show detailed information about it in a separate panel.

4. **UI Enhancements**:

   - Used Tailwind CSS classes to style the job posts list and the post detail panel.
   - Implemented hover effects and responsive design for a better user experience.

5. **Data Initialization**:
   - Initialized a predefined list of posts and added logic to push them to Firebase using the `addPost` function.

## Issues Encountered:

- None specific today.

## Next Steps:

1. Implement pagination or infinite scroll for the posts list if the data set grows larger.
2. Add validation and error handling for Firebase interactions.
3. Improve the UI/UX design further by adding more features (e.g., sorting, filtering).
4. Test the app with real data to ensure the interaction with Firebase works seamlessly.
